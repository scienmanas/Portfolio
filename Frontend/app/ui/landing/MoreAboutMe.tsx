            Apart from these tech stuff, I listen to a lot of music, play
            synthesizer ðŸŽ¹, like to read thriller + romantic novels , and watch
            cartoons and magic shows. Yes, I am a "porter head", Hogwarts is
            my home. Being a JEE student, I think I have always loved Physics ,
            and I'm crazy about discussions on Black Holes, Dark Matter, Dark
            Energy, etc. That's why I chose to lead my college Astronomy Club!

            I also do a little bit of poetry; you can read that in the blogs.
            Yeah, that's it! You read quite far. Thanks for sticking around! ðŸ™Œ
