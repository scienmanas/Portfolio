Hi I am Manas, and in this blog I will be discussing about the bruteforcing of btc wallet. For this I will use a script developed by myself - **Satoshi Cracker**. Firstly lets understand why bruteforcing btc wallet is nearly impossible.

## Why bruteforcing btc wallet is nearly impossible?

- Bitcoin uses 32 bytes of data to store the private key, thats nearly 256 bits of data. Now let's check number of possible public key/wallets possible. 

- 2^256 = 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936. Now thats a huge number, and if you try to bruteforce it, you will be dead before you can even reach 1% of the total possible wallets.

- So, the only way to get the private key is by using the public key, and that is nearly impossible.

- So here comes conclusion that bruteforcing btc wallet is nearly impossible.

## Satoshi Cracker

Now maybe you are still optimistic and want to try it out, so here is the script that I developed - **Satoshi Cracker**. Follow the steps below to run the script.

1. Clone the repository [link](https://github.com/scienmanas/Satoshi-Cracker).

2. Set up the env, the only variables you need to set is Email and Password so that u get reminder.

3. The script can be deployed on the cloud as the script contains a fast api server. So yeah you can use render. Juts run server.py file.

4. Enjoy the script and try your luck, donate me if you get lucky.
