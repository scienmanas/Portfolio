Late in October, I took a small break from everything. In that period, I don't know what came in my mind I started watching "**Pokemon**" again. Ahh... many new seasons were out since I last watched. And yeahh...ahhh... the Kalos region (XYZ series) just amazing. There was a new girl character introduced named: **Serena**, amazing choice.

Peeps who have seen the Kalos series, know that there was an episode, where she lost her first stage performance, expressing herself to be strong, but later in morning she can be seen crying alone. And at the same day, she starts a new chapter with changing her look and style with a new haircut. Okay.. enough of drama.

This poem somewhere revolves around her character and a new start.

```
She was not a perfect girl,
Not a winner, nor a loser,
Neither strong nor weak,
Yet she held something unique.

A fighter and a challenger,
A friend, a motivator,
A well of deep emotions,
And yes, a true light's creator.

Like a Daruma doll sheâ€™d rise,
Embracing new challenges, new beginnings,
Open to change, ready to move forward,
She is lightâ€”a pure, unyielding light.

```
