Hi, I am Manas and in this blog, I will be tell you how to use My Pookie, the no-code, free , open-source, SaaS webapp to wish your loved one on special occasions. The webapp allows to choose different occassion as well as different songs. Here I bring the concept of Pookie pages.

Pookie Pages are cute pages which a user can make for his/her special person which are fully customizable for your special messages. You can choose the occassion, songs and the message you want to convey.

In next section, instead of telling the setps, I want you to go through the video, the same is available on my youtube channel. I think it's better to demonstrate through videos instead of following the boring text steps.

## Demo

<div style="position: relative; width: 100%; padding-bottom: 56.25%; height: 0; overflow: hidden;">

  title="YouTube video player" 
  frameborder="0" 
  allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" 
  referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" 
  allowfullscreen 
  style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;">
  </iframe>
</div>

## Message

I was thinking to make this project last year (2024), but was no having skills of backend or Next Js, today this application is built using Next Js + Prisma. By making this project open-source and free, I am fulfilling my previous year's wish. I hope you will like this project and will use it to wish your loved ones.

This project is very close to my heart, as I have made it for my loved one. I hope you will also like it.

Cheers ðŸ¥‚,
