Hi, I am Manas and in this blog, I will tell you how to implement Google oAuth in any web application raw without using any library.

Follow the steps given below, additionally, you can watch the video for better understanding.

## Understanding oAuth

1. oAuth is an open standard for access delegation, commonly used as a way for Internet users to grant websites or applications access to their information on other websites but without giving them their passwords.

2. The below diagram shows the flow of oAuth.

<div style="text-align: center;">

    style="max-width: 100%; height: auto;" 
  />
</div>

Now, you need to understand the flow of oAuth.
1. The user clicks on the login button.
2. The user is redirected to the oAuth provider's login page.
3. The user logs in and gives permission to the application.
4. The oAuth provider redirects the user back to the application with a code.
5. The application exchanges the code with the access token and refresh token.
6. The application uses the access token to get the user's information.


## Steps to implement Google oAuth

First thing needs to be done in Google Cloud Console.

1. Go to [Google Developer Console](https://console.developers.google.com/).
2. Create a new project.
3. Go to the project and enable the Google oAuth API.
4. Create a new oAuth client ID.
5. Configure Consent Screen.
6. Add authorized JavaScript origins.
7. Add the redirect URI.
8. Copy the client ID and client secret.

### Now, let's move to the code.

1. The client is public, so we can store the client ID in the frontend.
2. Client secret is private, so we can't store it in the frontend. We will store it in the backend, and the redirect URI will be the backend endpoint.
3. Create a button in the frontend to login with Google.
4. On click of the button, open a new window with the Google oAuth URL.
5. By redirect URI, Google will redirect to the backend endpoint with the code.
6. In the backend, exchange the code with the access token and refresh token.
7. Use the access token to get the user's information.

That's it. You have successfully implemented Google oAuth in your web application. Now to make your application more secure, you can encrypt the access token and decrypt it in the backend.
