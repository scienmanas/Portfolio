The Poem name is - **"Rose Blooming"**. I wrote this on 21st June, 2024, when I was doing my internship in **IISc Banglore** and the **CEA NITE** was on that day. **CEA NITE** is a cultural event of **Chemical Deparment** of IISC which happens every year during June month. As always I was not going to perform but my Mentor insisted (iykuk ðŸ˜…).

So before I start the poem let me set the plot. There was a girl junior to me, when I was in 9th, she was in 8th. My first crush. I never talked to her, never had the courage to do so. But I always had a feeling for her. So this poem is dedicated to her.

Here it goes -

```
On one busy day in my regular schedule,
I saw a rose blooming, radiant and gentle.
In the midst of the rush, she was a spark so bright,
I was lost in her beauty, she was a sight.

The world looked a little different today,
Beacuse my eyes went to a different world, I must say.
At the same she passed besides me,
Making my heart skip a beat,

Her presence changed the essence of environment perceived to me,
Making me stand there like a new born petal on the stem,
In the crowd she seemed like a distinguished bright star,
Radiant and steady, shinning like a guiding pole star.

Everytime when I saw her, I felt ligher, like a feather,
Felt like I was recarnated to a new world, a new weather.
The busy day now seems to have a magic glaze,
All becuase of the rose, and her gentle stare. [go slow here]
```

I know this poems feels kinda incomplete ðŸ˜… but this was my first poem. Hope you like it.
